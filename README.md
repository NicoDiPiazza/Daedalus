# Daedalus

A simple dungeon generator.

To execute the code, simply run `python daedalus` in the root of the project
once you've installed the dependencies specified within requirements.txt.

## Future Plans

* Remove dead code
* Center the dungeon on the screen better
* Clean up code
  * Use enums for room type instead of strings
  * Change where the entrance room is specified
  * Improve selection system for boss and shop rooms

If you have any suggestions, feel free to open up an issue or submit a pull
request.
